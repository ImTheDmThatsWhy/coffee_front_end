Vite is a local development server that was written by Evan You, it will be used in the React side of this application to help build and develop the server. Vite also provides a built in server side rendering that will be utilised in this application. Vite will be used as its Hot Module Replacement system reduces wait times during production, and its production build time is faster compared to traditional build tools such as WebPaxk and Parcel (Source 1).

Licensing and Ethics: Vite is under the Mit license which can be found earlier in the Read Me. As this is an open license there is no ethical concerns about the use of Vite in this application as I have acknowledged that it is under the MIT license, in accordance with the license requirements Source 1.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

-   [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
-   [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Why React?

source: GeeksforGeeks. (2022). React VS Angular VS Vue - Which Framework is the Best? [online] Available at: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/react-vs-angular-vs-vue-which-framework-is-the-best/.

For this web application React will be used over its counterparts Vue.js and Angular. According to the source above React is a javascript library for user interfaces. Angular in comparison is a framework that uses a regular DOM, while Vue which is considered a progressive framework was created to be a better version of Angular with a custom tool. In terms of performance React is known for fast performance due to the virtual DOM implementation, React is also very flexible. In comparison Angular's performance can vary depending on how complex the app is and how its implemented. While Vue also as a high performance capacity it is not as well known as React. Therefore, as React is well known which will be useful for troubleshooting and learning purposes, is flexible and has a high performance capibility it will be used instead of Vue and Angular.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Product access:

The Buzz My Day Application will be a standalone application hosted on a remote server and accessible to users through a web browser.

## Project Dependencies

This project relies on the following which are explained in detail below:

-   axios
-   react
-   react-dom
-   react-router
-   react-router-dom
-   @fontsource/inter

## App Functions:

• User registration and login
• Search function for coffees
• Write, read, update, and delete reviews
• Create, read, update, and delete posts
• Save coffees to a favourites list

## Style Guide

This application uses the Prettier formatter as its style guide.

## Operating design:

• Web Browser: The web app will be accessible through Chrome, Safari, and Internet Explorer browsers.
• Responsive Design: The application will be designed using a mobile-first approach so that the web app can be accessed on tablets, mobiles, and desktop screens
• Cloud-based-server: Render will be used to deploy the application.
• Frontend: To create the frontend React will be used through vite.
• Database Deployment: To deploy the database MongoDB Cloud Atlas will be used.

## Style Guide

This application uses the Prettier formatter as its style guide. Prettier is being used in this applicationto help maintain code consistency throughout the JavaScript project. Follow the instructions in step 6 for VS code to install prettier: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-set-up-prettier-in-your-javascript-typescript-project/.

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
